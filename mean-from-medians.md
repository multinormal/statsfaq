# Meta-analysis of trials that publish armwise medians

## Introduction

A treatment effect is usually defined as the difference in expected outcomes between two or more groups. This article is going to use duration of mechanical ventilation as a continuous outcome that has been reported in observational studies. However, before continuing, it is important to state that this outcome is a time-to-event outcome and should probably not have been analyzed as a continuous outcome. Systematic reviews that include meta-analyses of studies that used suboptimal methods need to weigh such limitations when assessing risk of bias and certainty of evidence. Let's proceed by treating duration as a continuous outcome, even though we now know better.

If we are interested in the duration of mechanical ventilation until hospital discharge, the treatment effect of a new intervention would be the difference in the average (or expected) duration between the intervention group and the control group. This definition of treatment effect is central to meta-analysis, because meta-analysis combines results from many studies in order to estimate the treatment effect (or average treatment effect, for random-effects meta-analysis).

## Some Trials Report Armwise Medians

In practice, however, many trials and observational studies do not report treatment effects in this way. Instead of providing a difference in means (the typical treatment effect for continuous outcomes), some studies only publish armwise medians—for example, the median length of stay in the intervention group and the median length of stay in the control group. While medians are often useful for describing the “typical” patient, a direct comparison of medians does not have the same interpretation as a difference in means. This creates a challenge for meta-analysis, because standard meta-analytic methods are designed to pool treatment effect estimates such as mean differences, not medians.

## Imputing Difference in Means from Armwise Medians

From the perspective of meta-analysis, studies that report medians would ideally report differences in means. However, when means are not available, statistical methods have been developed to impute them from the reported medians and other summary statistics. To impute means that we use the information we do have (for example, medians, quartiles, and ranges) to generate a reasonable estimate of the information we do not have (in this case, the mean and standard deviation). A widely used approach was proposed by Wan et al. (2014), who developed formulas to approximate means and standard deviations from medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges. These methods have been taken up widely because they make it possible to include studies that would otherwise be excluded from quantitative synthesis.

While these imputation methods expand the pool of eligible studies, they are not perfect. Imputation introduces what is sometimes called imputation error. This refers to the difference between the imputed value and the true, but unreported, value. For example, if the true mean length of stay in a group was 10.5 days, but the imputation method estimated it as 9.8 days, the difference of 0.7 days represents imputation error. The amount of error depends on how well the assumptions of the imputation method match the actual distribution of the data. In particular, methods like Wan et al.’s work best when the underlying distribution is somewhat symmetric, although the paper demonstrates some robustness to this assumption. When data are strongly skewed, as may be the case for outcomes like duration of mechanical ventilation, imputation error can be larger.

For these reasons, results of meta-analyses that rely on imputed differences in means need to be interpreted carefully. The imputation allows more studies to be included in the meta-analysis, which can facilitate meta-analysis when all studies report medians, and can allow additional studies to be included that would otherwise have to be excluded from meta-analysis. However, the resulting treatment effect estimates may be influenced by error introduced in the imputation process. Recognizing this limitation is important for researchers and decision-makers who use meta-analysis to guide practice and policy when those meta-analyses rely on imputed differences in means. The next section presents a concrete example where the use of imputed means leads to a seemingly paradoxical result.

## Example: Duration of Hospital Stay

Duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants is a skewed outcome: most infants are extubated after a relatively short time, while a smaller number remain ventilated for much longer. This skewness means that different armwise summary measures can suggest different interpretations of treatment effect. In several observational studies comparing early versus late initiation of caffeine therapy, the reported **medians** for duration of ventilation consistently favored early initiation (i.e., shorter ventilation times). For example, in Dobson 2015, the median duration was 3 days for early initiation and 6 days for late initiation. However, when the medians and other summary statistics from each arm were used to impute differences in means to facilitate meta-analysis, the estimated **mean differences** generally pointed in the opposite direction, suggesting longer average ventilation times with early initiation.

This apparent inconsistency has two possible explanations. First, because of the skewed distribution, the median reflects the “typical” infant, whereas the mean is influenced by the long tail of infants who remain ventilated for extended periods. Second, the means used in the meta-analysis were not directly reported in the primary studies but were imputed using a statistical method that approximates the mean and its standard error. While this approach allows studies to be included in meta-analysis, two issues need to be considered. First, even if the imputed difference in mean is correct, the conclusion can be at odds with the observed medians, especially when distributions are strongly skewed. Second, there will be some degree of imputation error, and in principle the imputed treatment effect estimate can have the wrong direction of effect. 

## Conclusion

For meta-analysis, the aim is generally to estimate population-average treatment effects, so differences in means are generally preferred because they capture the overall burden patients, families, and health systems. Methods for meta-analyzing medians are much less well developed (probably because differences in medians are generally of less interest to systematic reviewers).

Researchers should be cautious in interpreting apparent contradictions between medians and imputed means. Rather than indicating error, these differences highlight how skewness and imputation methods can influence results. Reporting both, when possible, provides a more transparent and informative summary for decision-making.

These issues highlight an important but sometimes underappreciated distinction. Clinicians would ideally like evidence that helps them make treatment decisions for individual patients, which requires information on how treatment effects vary across patient characteristics (i.e., clinicians probably want conditional treatment effects). By contrast, most randomized trials and standard meta-analyses report population-level averages (i.e., marginal treatment effects). Conditional and marginal effects are not the same, and differences between them can matter when making decisions about an individual versus a population. While trials and meta-analyses can sometimes estimate conditional effects—for example, through subgroup analyses or meta-regression—these are often limited in scope. As a result, population-level estimates remain the main input for evidence synthesis, and care is needed when translating them into decisions for individual patients.
